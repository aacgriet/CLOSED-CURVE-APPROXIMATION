# CLOSED-CURVE-APPROXIMATION\

The objective of this work is to extract boundary of the object using minimum number of descriptors possible. In this thesis, boundary of the object in the image is extracted and several approximations of the boundary are observed and compared.
In this work, the following results are demonstrated: -
1.	Boundary is detected which describes the shape of the object.
2.	Using complex shape signature, different approximations of the original boundary are done till the approximated boundary resembles the original boundary.
3.	To improve the approximations using Fourier descriptors.
